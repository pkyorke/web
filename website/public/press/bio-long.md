P. K. Yorke is a composer and sound artist working at the intersection of percussion, spatial audio, and installation. Trained as a classical percussionist, Yorke’s work has expanded from the repertoire of contemporary concert music into a wider field of pieces for loudspeakers, architectures, and collaborative performance environments. Their scores frequently blur the line between fixed media and live performance, using canons of delays, spatialized textures, and unstable feedback systems to turn rooms into active partners in the music’s pacing and form. Yorke has created sound designs for theatre, produced electroacoustic works for multichannel loudspeaker systems, and written for ensembles ranging from solo percussion to chamber groups and electronics. Across these contexts, their practice is guided by a persistent question: how do spaces remember us, and how can sound make that memory audible over time?
