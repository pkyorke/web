P. K. Yorke is a composer, percussionist, and sound designer whose work spans concert pieces, sound installations, and collaborations with theatre and dance. Drawing on a background in percussion performance and electroacoustic practice, Yorke writes for instruments and multichannel loudspeaker arrays, often folding field recordings, room responses, and feedback systems into their pieces. Recent projects include works for percussion and electronics, sound designs for experimental theatre, and installation scores that unfold slowly across architectural spaces. Their practice treats rooms as collaborators rather than neutral containers, foregrounding how sound can reveal the way spaces remember people passing through them.
